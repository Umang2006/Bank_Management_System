## 🌟 Introduction

Managing bank accounts shouldn’t be complicated! This project is a simple, menu-driven Bank Management System built in C++ that uses a CSV file as a lightweight database. It demonstrates how core banking operations can be automated and persisted with clean code and user-friendly design.

## 🎯 Motivation

I wanted to learn how real-world applications store and manage data, and how to make those applications persistent and reliable. This project simulates a mini-banking system, focusing on practical file handling and command-line interaction.

## 🏆 Objective

- Provide a simple, persistent system for managing bank accounts
- Practice C++ fundamentals, file I/O, and data serialization
- Create a project that’s easy to use, understand, and extend

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C++** (Standard Library)
- **CSV** for data storage
- **File I/O** using `fstream`
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

## 🚀 Features

- Create, view, modify, and delete bank accounts
- Deposit and withdraw funds
- Persistent data storage in `accounts.csv`
- Intuitive CLI menu for all operations

## 📝 How It Works

- All account data is saved in `accounts.csv`—open it in Excel or Notepad to view records.
- Each menu option lets you manage accounts in real time.
- Data is automatically loaded and saved every time you run the program.

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. **Clone this repo**
2. **Compile:**  
   `g++ main.cpp -o bank_management`
3. **Run:**  
   `./bank_management` (or `bank_management.exe` on Windows)
4. **Follow the menu prompts!**

## 📂 Sample Data
